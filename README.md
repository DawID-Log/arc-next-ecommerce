## Account test

email: test@testvideo.tst

## Payment service
Currently, the option to activate a paid plan is not available for production. Currently payment is shown and accepted (using one of the following cards: https://docs.stripe.com/testing) but is not enabled because payment does not actually occur.
If you want to see the whole part, you may want to pull up the environment locally.
